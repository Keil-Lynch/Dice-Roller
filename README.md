# Dice-Roller
Simulate the rolling of a pair of dice with this program.

Two dice are rolled. 

Simulate the rolling of a pair of dice with this program.

Following each die's outcome is the sum of the numbers on both dice.
   
A single die can be simulated by selecting one of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. 

Whenever you select a number, that represents the number on the die after it is rolled.

This formula computes the numerical value between 1 and 6 by taking the product of (int)(Math.random()*6) + 1.

By using the expression given, we can calculate the value of dice1 and dice2.

To display the three lines of output, compute roll = dice1 + dice2 and use three System.out.println statements

Just run the program to simulate the dice rolls. You can run the program several times to get different outcomes from rolling the dice.
